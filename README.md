# Identifying-Cryptographic-Algorithm
This project implements a machine learning model to classify cryptographic algorithms (AES, DES, RSA) based on features extracted from ciphertext. The system analyzes entropy and length of encrypted data, trains a Random Forest model for classification, and allows users to input plaintext for encryption, decryption, and prediction.
